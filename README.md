Minerva-Mount-Sinai
===================

As a new user of Mount Sinai's Minerva high performance computying (HPC) system (https://hpc.mssm.edu/), it is taking me some time to learn basic (and not so basic) commands. I am not going to allow that such learning is used only once, although many know-how items described here may be extensively documented somewhere else...
