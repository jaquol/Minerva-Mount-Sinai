Minerva-Mount-Sinai
===================

As a new user of Mount Sinai's Minerva high performance computying (HPC) system (https://hpc.mssm.edu/), it is taking me some time to learn basic (and not so basic) commands. I am not going to allow that such learning is used only once, although many know-how items described here may be extensively documented somewhere else...


## fastqc

As many other toosl, fastq is a module in Minerva and using it requires loading it:

  > module load fastqc/0.10.1
